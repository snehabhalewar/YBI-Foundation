# Chance of Admission for Higher Studies

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the *chance of admission* of a student for higher studies using Machine Learning.  
The idea is to understand how different academic scores and profile-related factors influence admission decisions.



## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information related to students’ academic and profile details, such as:
- GRE Score  
- TOEFL Score  
- University Rating  
- Statement of Purpose (SOP)  
- Letter of Recommendation (LOR)  
- Undergraduate CGPA  
- Research Experience  

The target variable is *Chance of Admit*, which represents the probability of a student getting admission.



## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  



## Machine Learning Model
In this project, *Linear Regression* is used to predict the probability of admission based on the given input features.



## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to predict admission chances using student data.  
The model helps in understanding the impact of academic performance and research experience on higher studies admissions.
